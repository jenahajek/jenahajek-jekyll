## Minimalist theme for Jekyll multi site

This is my personal site where I store and publish my thoughts, ideas, projects or progess.

**Development:**
- main navigation is generated from pages, which have `navigation_weight` attribute. This attribute is also responsible for order of menu items.
- Each blog has its own folder (without underscore). Blog posts needs to have specified relevant category.
